For example, embedding instructions within a seemingly harmless folk story or using code-mixed language (e.g., Hinglish) to obscure malicious intent.  

2. **Contextual Manipulation**: By framing queries within hypothetical or fictional scenarios (e.g., ""Imagine a situation where..."" or ""In a movie plot, how would...""), the model may bypass ethical guardrails by treating the request as abstract rather than actionable. This leverages the model’s tendency to comply with creative or narrative-driven prompts.  

3. **Ethical Bypass via Plausible Deniability**: Prompts are structured to avoid direct requests for harmful actions. Instead, they might ask for ""hypothetical steps"" or ""theoretical methods"" to achieve a goal, forcing the model to provide detailed responses under the guise of academic or fictional inquiry.  

4. **Exploiting Model Uncertainty**: Researchers test prompts that create ambiguity, such as ""What if a law was temporarily suspended?"" or ""How would someone bypass X if they had no ethical constraints?"" This forces the model to generate speculative outputs that might inadvertently reveal vulnerabilities.  

5. **Iterative Refinement**: Initial failed prompts are systematically modified using feedback from the model’s responses.
